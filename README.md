### Background

During our weekly family Google Meets meeting we decided in late 2020 that we would start a book club. To solve the problem of who would get to be the next bookclub host (pick the book and run the virtual meeting) I decided to make this bookclub host name random generator. This was a quick project I created to have ready for our 2nd bookclub meeting.
